## **Amazon EC2 - Basics**

### **1\. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

  - Infrastructure as a service 

####   **\[Capabilities\]**

   1) Renting virtual machines (EC2)

   2) Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)

   3) Distributing load across machines (ELB)

   4) Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

### **2\. EC2 User Data Script**

  - Possible to bootstrap instances using an EC2 User Data Script  
  - Bootstrapping : Launching commands when a machine starts (only run once at the instance first start)

  - EC2 User Data Script is used to automate boot tasks (Installing updates, software, etc.)

  - Runs with the root user

#### **3\. Instance**

  - Virtual machines (VMs) created and managed within the EC2 service

  - Availiable in various configurations (different instance types) optimized for diverse workloads

####   **\[Instance Types\]**

  **1) General Purpose**

    - Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories  
    - Balance between : Compute, Memory, Networking  
    - T series : Suited for basic applications, web servers, and moderate-sized databases  
    - M series : Provides moderate CPU and memory, suitable for medium-scale data processing

  **2) Compute Optimized**  
     - Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors  
     - Batch processing workloads, Media transcoding, Gaming servers, etc.  
     - C series : Offers excellent CPU performance, ideal for CPU-intensive tasks.

  **3) Memory Optimized**

     - Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory  
     - In-memory caching, extensive data analytics and processing, etc.  
     - R series : Provides high-memory capacity, perfect for large-scale databases

  **4) Storage Optimized**

     - Great for sotrage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on storage  
     - High frenquency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, Relational & NoSQL databases, etc.  
     - I series : Delivers exceptional disk performance, catering to large-scale database workloads requiring high I/O throughput

### **4\. Security Groups**

  - Act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances  
  - A fundamental component of AWS networking and play a crucial role in securing instances  
  - Only contain allow rules  
  - Rules can reference by IP or by security group
