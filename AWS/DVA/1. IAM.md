## **AWS Identity & Access Management (AWS IAM)**

### **1\. IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

\- Service that allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.  
\- Enable to contorl who(authentication) can access what(authoriaztion) whitin AWS environment.

### **2\. Users & Groups**

1) Root  
\- Account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared

2) Users  
\- Represent individuals or applications interacting with AWS services  
\- Have unique security credentials to access AWS resources

3) Groups  
\- Users can be organized into groups  
\- Simplify permission management by assigning policies to groups rather than individual users.

### **3\. Policies**

\- JSON documents that define permissions  
\- Specify what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources for which users, groups, or roles.

\- Apply the least privilege principle

#### **\[IAM Policies Structure\]**

1) Version : Mandatory element indicating policy language version. Currently AWS use version "2012-10-17"

2) ID(optional) : An identifier for the policy

3) Statement : An array containing one or more individual statements

  - Sid(optional) : An identifier for the statement

  - Effect : Determines whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)  
  - Principal(optional) : Account/User/Role to which this policy applied to  
  - Action : Specifies the permitted or denied actions  
  - Resource : Identifies the AWS resources to which the actions apply   
  - Condition(optional) : Defines additional contextual contraints

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "ec2:TerminateInstances",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "false"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### **4\. MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)**

\- A security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to user sign-ins and account access  
  (MFA = password you know + security device you own)  
\- Requires users to present two or more forms of verification before granting access to AWS resources  
\- Additional step than enhances security by making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access

### **5\. Access AWS**

1) AWS Management Console : protected by password + MFA

2) AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) : protected by access keys  
 - Users manage their own access keys  
 - CLI is a tool that enables users to interact with AWS services using commands in command-line shell  
3) AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) : protected by access keys  
 - SDK enables users to access and manage AWS services programmatically and can be embedded within application

### **6\. IAM Security Tools (Audit)**

1) IAM Crendentials Report (account-level)

  - A report that lists all account's users and the status of their various credentials

2) IAM Access Advisor (user-level)

  - Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed
